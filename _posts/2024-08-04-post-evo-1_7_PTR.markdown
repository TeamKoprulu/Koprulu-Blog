**Balance Changes**

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Divider_Terran.png)

*Terran has received build time reductions across the board to mitigate their weakness in remaxing large armies.*

- Increased Bunker HP 350 -> 400
- Increased Bunker build time 21 -> 29

*These changes bolster Terran's early-game defenses and compensate for a lack of Salvage, without making the Bunker overwhelming when used in rushes.*

- Decreased Control Tower build time 21 -> 18
- Decreased Control Tower cost 50/50 -> 50/25
- Decreased Covert Ops build time 21 -> 18
- Decreased Covert Ops cost 50/50 -> 50/25

*These changes bring these add-ons in line with SC2 Terran's Tech Lab.*

- Decreased Science Facility build time 46 -> 43

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-terran-marine@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Marine

- Decreased Marine build time 18 -> 17
- Decreased Stimpack research time 79 -> 57
- Decreased U-238 Shells research cost 150/100 -> 100/100
- Increased U-238 Shells research time 67 -> 79

*These changes enable faster early-game bio-pushes, while delaying mid-game bio all-ins.*

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-terran-firebat@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Firebat

- Decreased Firebat build time 19 -> 17
- Increased Firebat HP 60 -> 65

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-terran-medic@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Medic

- Decreased Medic build time 18 -> 17
- Decreased Medic's attack target priority value

*Medics frequently die first in engagements. Reducing their priority will enhance their survivability.*

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-terran-vulture@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Vulture

- Decreased Vulture build time 21 -> 19

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-terran-siegetank-sieged@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Siege Tank

- Increased Siege Mode research cost 100/100 -> 50/50
- Decreased Siege Tank Tank Mode attack period 1.65 -> 1.58
- Decreased Siege Tank Siege Mode attack period 3.01 -> 2.70

*These changes make the critically underwhelming Siege Tank more powerful.*

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-terran-goliath@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Goliath

- Decreased Goliath build time 24 -> 22

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-terran-wraith@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Wraith

- Decreased Wraith build time 30 -> 27

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-terran-dropship@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Dropship

- Decreased Dropship build time 30 -> 27

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-terran-valkyrie@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Valkyrie

- Decreased Valkyrie build time 36 -> 33

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-terran-sciencevessel@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Science Vessel

- Decreased Science Vessel build time 43 -> 39
- Decreased Science Vessel cost 100/225 -> 100/200
- Decreased EMP research cost 200/200 -> 150/150
- Decreased EMP research time 100 -> 79
- Decreased Irradiate research cost 200/200 -> 150/150

*These buffs compensate for the nerfs to the Science Vessel last patch, and increase its utility against Protoss.*

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Divider_Zerg.png)

- Decreased Evolution Chamber build time 25 -> 20
- Decreased Creep Colony cost 75 -> 50
- Decreased Spore Colony Cost 50 -> 25
- Increased Spore Colony attack range 8 -> 8.5
- Increased Sunken Colony HP 300 -> 350
- Increased Sunken Colony attack range 7 -> 7.5

*Zerg's lacking early-game defenses have been a crippling weakness. These changes compensate for the Sunken and Spore Colony's immobility and make them more accessible.*

- Decreased Spire cost 200/150 -> 150/100
- Decreased Queen's Nest cost 150/100 -> 100/100
- Decreased Greater Spire morph time 71 -> 57

*These changes ease Zerg's overall tech progression and allow them to more quickly diversify their army composition.*

- Adjusted default hotkeys for Overlord upgrades

*The default hotkey arrangement caused many player mistakes, so they were changed to be more spread-out over the keyboard.*

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-zerg-zergling@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Zergling

- Decreased attack period 0.43 -> 0.41
- Decreased Metabolic Boost research time 74 -> 71

*The Zergling is currently not an effective combat unit. Increasing its attack speed will remedy this. The Metabolic Boost research time reduction specifically targets their interaction against Reapers.*

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-zerg-hydralisk@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Hydralisk

- Increased attack range 4 -> 5
- Decreased Grooved Spines range bonus +2 -> +1

*Granting the Hydralisk additional initial range enables it to better serve its early defensive role.*

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-zerg-lurker@scbw.png" width="50" height="50">

- Increased HP 135 -> 140
- Decreased morph time 18 -> 15
- Decreased Lurker Aspect research cost 200/200 -> 150/150

*Lurkers are currently too expensive and ineffective. These changes make them a stronger bridge between the early-game and late-game.*

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-zerg-defiler@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Defiler

- Increased HP 80 -> 90
- Decreased Plague casting delay 0.04 -> 0

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-zerg-overlord@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Overlord

- Decreased Ventral Sacs research time 93 -> 71

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Divider_Protoss.png)

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-protoss-zealot@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Zealot

- Decreased build time 27 -> 24

*This change strengthens Protoss's early-game pressure.*

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-protoss-hightemplar@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> High Templar

- Decreased Hallucination energy cost 75 -> 50
- Decreased Hallucination research cost 100/100 -> 50/50
- Decreased Hallucination research time 64 -> 57

*Hallucination is currently a very underused spell, so these changes should help it see some use.*

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-protoss-darkarchon@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Dark Archon

- Increased shield HP 200 -> 225
- Increased Maelstrom duration 9 -> 11
- Decreased Maelstrom research time 69 -> 57

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-protoss-shuttle@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Shuttle

- Decreased Gravitic Drive research cost 150/150 -> 100/100

*This change brings the Shuttle's movement speed upgrade in line with that of the Warp Prism.*

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-protoss-reaver@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Reaver

- Decreased Reaver build time 47 -> 39
- Decreased Scarab Damage research cost 150/150 -> 125/125
- Reduced Scarab Damage research time 100 -> 79
- Decreased Reaver Increased Capacity research cost 150/150 -> 125/125
- Decreased Reaver Increased Capacity research time 93 -> 57

*These changes ensure that the Reaver is an effective unit in the mid-game. In particular, the Reaver Increased Capacity research was rarely used and was in dire need of a change.*

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-protoss-carrier@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Carrier

- Decreased Interceptor launch period 0.58 -> 0.25

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-protoss-arbiter@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Arbiter

- Decreased build time 75 -> 69
