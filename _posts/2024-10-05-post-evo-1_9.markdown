## Evo Complete Extension Update 1.9

Hey everyone the team has been hard at work on the Campaign for Update 2.0, the Miss Chance feature we've been testing requires some adjustments and won't be in this update but it will be available again in the PTR once we've made the appropriate adjustments.

We got a bit of a surprise for you guys this time as we've finished our Queen's Nest Model complete with a Death Model, several other art adjustments are being made to all our custom Zerg units that will come either with 2.0 or as part of upcoming hotfixes.

With the Upcoming SEL the balance team has decided to push out the PTR changes to live while we continue to work on 2.0, we hope to have more news in the future or you can join us in Patreon or as a Donor to receive exclusive updates.

As always thank you to all our Patreons and Donors for all their help in funding this project, we hope to continue to make more amazing things and deliver the best remake we possibly can.

- Nukes now deal 500 damage or 2/3rd's of the targets life whichever is greater
- Merging Archons & Dark Archons morphs now keep some buffs from both source units, (ie. Negative buffs like Parasite will now be transfered to the merged archon)

Reaver now more closely mimics it's SC1 version
- Structure & Resource footprints are no longer considered when checking for weapon range
- Reavers no longer auto-acquire targets it can't walk to (ie. it wont automatically shoot at target behind a building wall, but it can be ordered to do it manually by a player)
- Fixed Reaver being capable having multiple Scarabs out at the same time
