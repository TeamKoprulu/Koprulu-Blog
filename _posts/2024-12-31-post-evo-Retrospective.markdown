## Dear Commanders,
Hello!
Since the release of the campaign demo last October, StarCraft: Evolution Complete has received widespread attention from the player community. The intense battles in multiplayer mode, the deep dives into the single-player campaign demo, and the enthusiastic anticipation for the development of competitive events have all been the driving forces behind our continuous improvement. Here, the entire development team extends our heartfelt gratitude to all players who have followed and supported StarCraft: Evolution Complete.

Over the past few months, the development team has been continuously optimizing and expanding the game to deliver a richer and more exciting experience. Below, we will introduce the project’s current progress and plans in three parts: multiplayer, campaign, and competitive matches. Please note that the content here is only a preliminary showcase of the development phase, and the final release version may differ.

We'd like to give everyone an update of what we've done over the last year as well as some things we're very excited to work on during 2025.

## Multiplayer

In Multiplayer mode, two main mods have drawn significant attention from players:

- SC: Evo Complete
This is the primary expansion Mod, allowing players to battle using races from both StarCraft and StarCraft 2. It is the most popular mod to date. Following a series of modern updates and balance adjustments, the unit data from StarCraft has been modified while retaining its original flavor. As StarCraft 2 still undergoes balancing changes and players' proficiency continues to evolve, we will maintain a close eye on the balance of this mod and make adjustments if necessary.

- SC: Evo Complete Legacy
This Mod focuses on Brood War only, combining the core mechanics of Brood War with modern features from StarCraft 2 under StarCraft 2 engine, achieving a complete recreation of original Brood War. This mod is nearly complete, and future updates will primarily focus on art enhancements and bug fixes.

Updates over the past year for multiplayer include:

- Art updates
This year alone we added over 25 New Models, 17 of which were brand new Sculpted models from scratch, not including the huge number of changes we made to existing models.

- Competitive map pool updates
Classic maps that have accompanied us for over the last two decades have been faithfully recreated. To achieve this, custom textures, models, and other assets are developed. As of now, we have released 14 competitive maps. Additionally, many enthusiastic community authors have created numerous high-quality custom maps. A heartfelt thank you to them! These maps, prefixed with “[SC:EVO Official],” are available for players to experience in custom games.

- New skin system
We have introduced experimental skin settings, including classic Brood War style buttons and the Daelaam Protoss Nexus. We're working to expand this system with new skins as well as a revamped UI for skin viewing and selection.

Planned updates for Multiplayer include:

- Art updates

Although we have iterated on models and textures multiple times over the past year, there is still some distance to our goal. In future updates, we will accelerate the pace of art updates, bringing you a full suite of StarCraft 1 building, unit, and effect models.

- Ranking system

Good news for competitive players! A ranking system similar to “ladder” will be introduced to multiplayer mode. Currently, we are developing backend code and the user interface for this feature while testing a matchmaking bot on Discord to facilitate matches between players of similar skill levels. The tentative plan is to first conduct limited internal testing, followed by an open beta, and finally launch it after continuous optimization. We will share more details as progress is made.

Do not however that this Ranking System will only be made available via an Arcade type map and will not feature matchmaking due to technical limitations.

- New lobby interface

To enhance the competitive experience and highlight the unique features of the SC:EVO project, we plan to adjust the game lobby interface. This update is part of the user interface changes mentioned under the “ranking system” section. Currently, we have only a rough concept sketch to share. If you have better ideas, feel free to let us know!

- More competitive maps

Although the development of competitive maps started late, the map creators have contributed many exquisite original or ported maps—thank you again! We believe a continuously updated map pool can greatly enhance the freshness of competitive battles, as gameplay can vary dramatically under different styles and layouts. Therefore, we will collaborate with community authors to maintain high-quality competitive map updates.


## Campaign

Design Philosophy
Over the past two decades, StarCraft’s epic story has made a lasting impact on players, both old and new. However, due to the technological limitations of its time, many of the missions in the original campaign now feel somewhat dated, leading to a more repetitive gameplay experience. With this in mind, our core design philosophy is centered around “preserving the classic while enhancing the experience.” We aim to stay true to the original narrative and mission structure while introducing modern design elements. These include a more engaging sense of progression between missions and more dynamic, varied map layouts to keep players on their toes.

Armory System 
To further enhance the single-player experience, we’re excited to introduce the Armory System, inspired by the upgrade system in Wings of Liberty. This system allows players to unlock powerful upgrades by completing missions and optional objectives. These upgrades offer a mix of strategic choices, with some enhancing existing units and others fundamentally altering the roles of certain units. While the Armory System is still evolving, we’ve already mapped out a diverse range of upgrades that will add depth to your tactical decisions.

Map Remastering 
In addition to gameplay changes, we’re remastering the original campaign maps to provide a more immersive experience. Our focus is on improving visual elements, enhancing narrative flow, and refining AI behavior for more logical and challenging encounters. This remastering also includes better terrain design and storytelling elements that will make each mission feel more cohesive and engaging. Below are some screenshots from Mission 5 of the Loomings Campaign.

Competitive Matches
From community-organized tournaments in PC bangs during early days to global champion ship series whether online or offline, for the last two decades, competitive events have become an inseparable part of the StarCraft series. SC:EVO has also hosted multiple exciting tournaments (organized by @HyperONE—many thanks for his efforts!). These events not only provided engaging matches but also offered players a platform to compete with high-level opponents (even professional players) while collecting valuable data for balancing updates to the MOD.

Not long ago, the SCEvo League (SEL) Fall Championship concluded, with the participants delivering many sets of thrilling matches. Congratulations to Dark for winning the SEL Fall Championship!

Looking ahead, we will strive to maintain the current tournament structure within budget constraints. We eagerly look forward to the SEL Bi-Weekly Series returning next year and reuniting with the players!
