### Balance Changes
*Please note: All time values are provided in Normal Speed [Faster Speed]. Normal values provided are exact; Faster values are approximate.*

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Divider_Terran.png)

- Increased Engineering Bay build time: 30 -> 40 [21.4 -> 28.6]

Previously, the Engineering Bay had its build time reduced as a way to hasten access to Missile Turrets as a response to SC2 Protoss Stargate openers. The need for this has passed, as BW Terran players have demonstrated ways to survive the early game without this change. Moreover, the Engineering Bay's build time being even faster than that of its SC2 counterpart, as well as its ability to Lift Off and scout the opponent's base after it is done being used to block an expansion, make it an incredibly cost-effective option in the early game. We are increasing its build time to reflect this.

- Increased Barracks build time: 67 -> 70 [47.9 -> 50.0]
- Increased Stimpack research time: 75 -> 85 [53.6 -> 60.7]

SC2 Zerg players currently face a dilemma against BW Terran. As Stimpack timings have become more optimized in this matchup, BW Terran players have devised methods to deny virtually all scouting information to the opponent, killing the first Overlord on-sight and shutting Zerglings out with Barracks-Depot full walls at the natural. Due to this, it is nigh-impossible for SC2 Zerg players to verify the true number of Barracks built or check the timing of the natural Command Center. This is concerning, since BW Terran is capable of both exorbitant greed and fast, heavy pressure, the latter of which cannot be reliably defended against without blindly morping Spine Crawlers or Roaches.

In order to mitigate the strength of Stimpack timing openers, we are increasing the time required to build the Barracks and research Stimpack. These should help permit more margin for error in earlygame Overlord movements and preparing defenses for the initial wave of Marines.

- Increased Comsat Station HP: 500 -> 550
- Decreased Machine Shop HP: 750 -> 550
- Increased Control Tower HP: 500 -> 550
- Decreased Physics Lab HP: 600 -> 550
- Decreased Covert Ops HP: 750 -> 550
- Decreased Nuclear Silo HP: 600 -> 550

These changes serve to further standardize the stats of Terran add-ons, as well as reduce their overall HP-to-cost ratio to more reasonable levels and increase opportunities to interact with Terran production.

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-terran-medic.png" width="50" height="50"> Medic
- Decreased HP: 65 -> 60

Due to their HP, Medics are often seen tanking Corrosive Biles in engagements against Roach-Ravager armies. By design, Biles are supposed to force the opponent to dodge, but the Medic is able to survive one hit without dodging. Therefore, we are reducing its HP to force Terran players to control their Medics more carefully.

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-terran-siegetank-sieged@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Siege Tank
- Decreased Tank Mode attack period: 2.212 -> 1.7875 [1.58 -> 1.28]

This change helps to make the currently underwhelming strength of the Brood War Siege Tank's Tank Mode weapon proportionate to that of the StarCraft II Siege Tank.

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-terran-goliath@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Goliath
- Increased anti-ground weapon attack period: 1.3125 -> 1.425 [0.94 -> 1.02]

In spite of repeated adjustments its anti-ground weapon, the Goliath remains an overwhelmingly strong generalist. As we still believe its anti-air capabilities are in a good spot, we are proceeding with further nerfs to its anti-ground attack period.

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-terran-dropship@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Dropship
- Increased deceleration: 1.0625 → 1.375 [1.49 → 1.93]

This change will help a Dropship issued a simple Drop command to arrive at its destination slightly faster by delaying the time at which it automatically begins to slow.

Note: We do not plan to substantially increase the acceleration of the Dropship in future patches. The Dropship is, and always has been, a more committal tool by design. It is not a Medivac, and is not intended to be able to quickly rotate between bases or retrieve stranded forces at the sight of enemy defenses.

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-terran-battlecruiser@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Battlecruiser
- Decreased build time: 90 -> 80 [64.3 -> 57.1]

Although we think the Battlecruiser's combat capabilities are well-tuned, it is still difficult for Terran to find opportunities to transition into it. We hope to remedy this with a slight build time reduction.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Divider_Zerg.png)

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-building-zerg-sunkencolony@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Sunken Colony
- Increased build time: 18 -> 20 [12.9 -> 14.3]

Lately, Sunken Colony rushes have been quite prevalent in the Brood War Zerg vs StarCraft II Zerg matchup. Moreover, due to its build time, rushes involving the Sunken Colony lie on a wide spectrum, from simple macro pressures to outright all-ins, making its use somewhat unpredictable. Although we do not think defending successfully against these builds is too difficult, we would like to incentivize more opening variety from BW Zerg players.

As early interactions in the BW Zerg vs SC2 Zerg matchup are very sensitive to a couple seconds of build time, we believe this change is enough to achieve our intended effect. A couple seconds of increased build time should not affect the Sunken Colony's utility in other matchups and scenarios.

Note: The build time was nerfed to 21 seconds [15.0 seconds] during the 1.13 PTR, but this nerf has been reduced for the live version to ensure the Sunken Colony remains an effective response to Baneling busts and cannon rushes, which are also highly time-sensitive interactions in the earlygame.

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-zerg-defiler@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Defiler
- Consume now requires research at the **Defiler Mound** to be unlocked
    - Research cost: 100/100
    - Research time: 80 seconds [57.1 seconds]

This change continues our efforts to bring the BW races more in-line with their original versions. In particular, this change will help to mitigate BW Zerg's tempo advantage entering the lategame by delaying the timing at which Dark Swarm and Plague become plentiful.

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-zerg-devourerex3.png" width="50" height="50"> Devourer
- Increased HP: 250 -> 275
- Decreased armor: 3 -> 2
- Decreased attack period: 6.25 -> 5.8125 [4.46 -> 4.15]
- Increased attack range: 6 -> 7
- Adjusted Acid Spores attack speed reduction to match Brood War behavior. Now increases weapon cooldown linearly instead of exponentially.
    - Old Formula: NewCooldown = BaseCooldown x [(8/7) ^ AcidSporesLevel]
    - New Formula: NewCooldown = BaseCooldown x [1 + ({1/8} x AcidSporesLevel)]

As with the Defiler, these changes continue our efforts to capture the original identity of the Brood War races. The attack period and Acid Spores changes more closely aligns the Devourer with its Brood War incarnation. The remaining changes re-emphasize its role as a hit-and-run support unit. The reduction in armor back to its original value makes it more vulnerable to basic anti-air attacks once more and discourages its prolonged use in battle. To more precisely fine-tune its survivability and compensate for the lost armor, we are increasing its HP slightly, and the increase to its range will better help it maintain a safe distance when applying Acid Spores. In particular, an HP of 275 will allow it to barely survive two uses of the StarCraft II Ghost's Steady Targeting.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Divider_Protoss.png)

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-protoss-scout q@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Scout
- Increased anti-ground weapon attack range: 4 -> 5

One of the historical hindrances to widespread adoption of Scout play is the ineffectiveness of its anti-ground weapon. This change makes it easier to use by making its range consistent with that of the Wraith.

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-protoss-carrier@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Carrier
- Decreased build time: 90 -> 80 [64.3 -> 57.1]

Although we think the Carrier's combat capabilities are well-tuned, it is still difficult for Protoss to find opportunities to transition into it. We hope to remedy this with a slight build time reduction.
