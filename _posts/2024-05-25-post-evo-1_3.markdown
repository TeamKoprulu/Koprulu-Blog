## Evo Complete Extension Update 1.3

Hey everyone we got a minor update to fix some bugs, visual issues as well as add some features and update some visuals. Due to how close this update is to the upcoming tournament we decided to stall our balance update for a little while.

As for next update we'll be deploying a PTR to test some radical changes.

We're holding off from adding new models in the meantime to 100% finish some of the new models added for 1.0 such as adding the full suite of death models, variations and animation adjustments across the board, in the meantime we have a little teaser of some of the upcoming content.

***This Update has been stalled in the Asia region due to how close it is to the Tasteless Showmatch, instead it's available under the PTR***

Multiplayer data is now separated from the extension mod so it can be easier to use by other modders. It can be found under "SCEvo_Multi" as an dependency mod
This new dependency mod has no attributes added or Observer mod included and contains all SC: Evo Balance Data.
