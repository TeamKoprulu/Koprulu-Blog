## Evo Complete Extension Update 1.6

Hey everyone, we got a minor update containing some balance changes, bugfixes and support for some upcoming features being deployed sometime soon.

The New Legacy Update allows mapmakers to fine tune their maps for Legacy by adjusting mineral amounts to desired values, removing rich minerals and removing additional geysers properly. Full Notes below.
