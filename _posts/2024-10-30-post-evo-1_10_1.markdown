## Evo Complete Extension Update 1.10

Hey everyone we have a Minor patch to address some balance concerns as well as some much needed buffs to some units, this update also addresses some model issues that we previously had specifically with the Siege Tank.

We have a larger balance patch in the works but it needs more time for all the data to be reviewed.

As always thank you to all our Patreons and Donors for all their help in funding this project, we hope to continue to make more amazing things and deliver the best remake we possibly can.
