## Evo Complete Extension Release 1.0

Hey everyone, we've been working hard for a while along with our advisors to create this update which aims at closing the gap in balance between BW and SC2 races, this update most notable contains buffs to improve the game tempo of BW races as well as changes to Explosive and Concussive weapons to improve their performance, particularly in BW vs SC2 Scenarios.

Along with this update we've also added several new models that the team has been working hard to get out the door. A series of minor updates to the core of the mods will be deployed to continue to make adjustments to the art as well as add new models eventually.

Finally from the Dev team we'd like to wish the best to all the players participating in the Supermatch and GL HF, we'll be eagerly awaiting the event's date. Without further ado here are the patch notes.
