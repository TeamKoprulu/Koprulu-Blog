## Evo Complete Extension Update 1.10

Hey everyone we have a Minor patch to address some balance concerns as well as some much needed buffs to some units, this update also addresses some model issues that we previously had specifically with the Siege Tank.

We have a larger balance patch in the works but it needs more time for all the data to be reviewed.

As always thank you to all our Patreons and Donors for all their help in funding this project, we hope to continue to make more amazing things and deliver the best remake we possibly can.

- Hydrlisk's Weapon is now a Hitscan __(Core)__

***This means that their attacks no longer have a travel time and will hit units instantly**

- Reduced Weapon Range from 7.5 -> 7.0

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-building-protoss-shieldbattery@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Shield Battery
- Recharge Shields ability removed.
- Restore ability added:
  - Restore heals shields automatically.
  - Restore does not stun its target.
  - Restore heals 3 shields per Energy, instead of 2 shields per Energy.
  - Restore heals 28 shields per second, instead of 112 shields per second.
  - Restore, like Recharge Shields, cannot target structures.

***We will be monitoring this change in the coming days to decide if the heal value and energy costs need to be adjusted.***


### Bug fixes & changes
- Fixed an issue that would cause Ensnare to not properly negate the effects of Stimpack
