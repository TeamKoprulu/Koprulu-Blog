## Evo Complete Extension Release 0.26

Hey everyone! we've prepared a new balance patch for Evo addressing some issues that have been reported by our advisors as well as well as from watching streamers and youtube videos, we thank you for your patience while we are still dealing with balance concerns with the only hope that we will continue to do better with time.

Without further ado here are the patch notes, we've made some major balance changes as well as added several StarCraft 1 Mechanics that could result in a buff/nerf to some units, also in this update we've enhanced several game assets.

***

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Divider_Extension.png)

* Added Hover attribute to High Templars, Reaper, Sentry and Disruptor

_We've added the Hover attribute to these units to mix the Spider Mine mechanics with some of the sc2 units. Units with the Hover attribute can walk over mines without triggering them_

*Hovering Units being ignored by Spider Mines*

* Adjusted the stats of static defenses such as the Missile Turret, Sunken Colony, Photon Cannon, etc

_We've buffed the static defenses of all races to be more competitive with Starcraft 2 as they were previously much weaker and less effective at nearly the same cost_ 

***

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Divider_Terran.png)

* Factory mineral cost 200 -> 150
* Increased Marine range research time 60 -> 94
* Reduced Medic Restoration research time 90 -> 75 & cost 100/100 -> 50/50
* Increased Missile Turret explosive damage 20 -> 25
* Increased Ghost Lockdown range 9 -> 10
* Increased Goliath life 125 -> 150

_This Goliath change should allow them to survive at least two Liberator attacks, this is in line with StarCraft 2 balance for Mech types_

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-protoss-zealot@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Zealot

* Increased Zealot Leg Enhancments speed multipler 1.5 -> 1.6
* Corrected the Zealot Changeling not using the same Shield amount

* Photon Cannon weapon speed and life matched to sc2 photon cannon
* Cybernetics core mineral cost 200 -> 150
* Robotics Facility mineral cost 200 -> 150
* Observatory cost 50/100 -> 100/50
* Observatory build time 20 -> 28
* High Templar build time 55 -> 45
* Dark Templar build time 50 -> 45
* Shuttle increase life 80 -> 100 & Shields 60 -> 70
* Arbiter Vespene cost 350 -> 300
* Arbiter Recall energy cost 150 -> 125


![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Divider_Zerg.png)

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-zerg-lurker.png" width="50" height="50"> Lurker

* Reduced Burrowing time from 2.5 -> 2.0 
* Increased weapon range from 7 -> 8
* Weapon added +5 damage to light

_These changes to the Lurker bring them up with the buffs to the other races, as they were previously underperforming due to a smaller range, damage and burrowing times. The weapon change allows Lurkers to kill Starcraft 1 Marines in two attacks and the Burrow time remains slower than a Starcraft 2 Lurker with the Adaptive Talons upgrade._

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-zerg-queen@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Queen

* Temporarily disabled sc2 Command Centers being able to be targeted by Queens Infest ability

_While we have no concrete news on what sc2 Command Centers will be able to do while infested we are working on a new feature to replace it._

* Spawn Broodling can now target massive targets
* Spawn Broodling can now only target non-robotic mechanical or biological targets
* Spawn Broodling now Deals 300 + 100 vs biological instead of instantly killing the target
* Spawn Broodling will fail if target goes into stasis
* Disruptor, Colossus, Sentry, Reaver, Probes & Widow Mine now have robotic attribute
* Increase Spawn Broodling launch volume

_This damage change keeps the original Starcraft 1 interactions intact, (with the exception of defensive matrix) while targets like Thor and SC2 Ultralisk now require two casts to be killed by Queens._

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-unit-zerg-defiler@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Defiler

* Defiler Dark Swarm energy cost 75 -> 100
* Most fire type weapons now deal damage in Dark Swarm, this now includes Colossus and Hellion

### <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/btn-building-zerg-sporecolony@scbw.png" width="50" height="50"> Spore Colony
* Spore Colony damage increased 15 -> 25
* Spore Colony weapon range increased 7 -> 8

_The Spore Colony's weapon has been adjusted based on it's cost (175 minerals total)_

* Fixed Spore Colony using incorrect morph time 19 -> to 15
* Fixed Sunken Colony using incorrect morph time 19 -> to 35

_Morph times match SC2 drone equivalents when creep colony build time is included_

* Increased Larva spawn delay from 12 -> 13

_We're continuing to adjust the Larva spawn times as we make additional adjustments to the Zerg race_

* Interceptors can only enter Carrier while it is stationary
* Interceptors will now retreat to the carrier if they are at 0 shields
* Interceptors will now repair their shields and life when inside the carrier
* Interceptors can only exit the carrier when life is above 20 

_The shield regen rate is comparable to shield battery instead of instant heal as it used to be in StarCraft 1. Special checks have been done to allow them to exit the carrier while affected by plague_

* Interceptor weapon speed reduced 1.554 -> 1.875

![]({{site.baseurl}}/gifs/2024-30-04-burrowedmines.gif)

* Spider Mine can't target enemy spider mines (they still deal damage to own and other spider mines if exploding near them)
* Reduced the time spider mine re-burrows after unburrowing
* Spider Mine placement range reduced from 0.6 -> 0.5
* Spider Mine now takes priority over other units when targeting units in the same location

_This is mimicing the vulture behavior in sc1 and should prevent usage of the spider mine in fights without penalty_

*Vultures placing down Spider Mines now have a short cast "Animation" after one is used*
