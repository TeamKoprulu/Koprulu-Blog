Today we celebrate the release of the SC Evo Crossover Edition mod, this mod is a much more in-depth update of the old SC1 vs SC2 Extension mod including some new units, abilities and upgrades as well as a much better balanced AI.

We want to start this new post on our new site by publishing the patchnotes for our upcoming Update 1.0 to the Crossover Edition as well as thank everyone who has made this project possible and all the love and passion we've seen from the Korean community that inspire this update. 

Coming in this update we're including the Reaver rework thanks to SardineS for allowing us to use his data and upgrade, you can find him at his [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/sardinestv) or [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@SardineS_tv) channel. Without further ado below are the update notes as well as some comments from the dev team on how or why some changes were made.

For this update we have finished the Korean Translation featuring:
- Fully Translated Text
- Korean Voices
- Korean Portrait Animations

_For starters we've made several adjustments to the game balance of all three races to have a much more even fighting chance against their sc2 counterparts as well as removed several features that are exclusive to the legacy and campaign versions of the game._

* Removed bonus damage vs Shields from Explosive and Concussive Weapons
* Reworked Damage bonuses across most SC1 Units, Explosive and Concussive weapons now gain +1 damage to armored/light for each weapon upgrade (Damage bonuses from upgrades have been adjusted accordingly)
* Reworked SC1 Unit Attributes
* Adjusted Several Interactions between SC1 and SC2 Spells
* Adjusted attack periods of most SC1 Units

_These changes are aimed at making the weapons across both races compatible allowing the sc2 damage bonuses to work on sc1 units and vice versa._

* Adjusted all Armor and Weapon Upgrade times to comply with the newest balance patch
* Adjusted all Vespene Collector costs to comply with the newest balance patch

_From the feedback we received on the terran sc1 vs sc2 balance some of the comments pointed out at the lack of a way to improve the unit production speed, while we do not yet have a solution we're exploring a couple options and if you have a suggestion feel free to drop it in the Discord._

* AI is temporarily disabled

_The AI has not yet been tuned due to several balance changes we've made as well as the AI being noticeably weaker than its sc2 counterpart. The builds are currently being adjusted and will be coming in the next major patch._

*Base Stinger*

*Helios Tracer Rounds Upgraded*


_The New Stinger unit is meant to help out Terran players with a response to the Cyclone, the Stinger can be built at the Factory and requires an attached Machine shop and is equipped with two weapons, a Gatling gun able to deal 8 damage (+8 vs Mechanical) and a Grenade Launcher that can only target buildings for 20 Damage, the Stinger can also be upgraded with the *Helios Tracer Rounds* allowing it to target enemies while moving._

_We cannot wait for players to get their hands on the Stinger and try out new strategies, we're open to any possible changes to this new Unit and we'd like to show our commitment and flexibility to add new things or make some changes._


* Added Dropship Emergency Thrusters Upgrade at the Control Tower
* Added Dropship Emergency Thrusters Ability

![]({{site.baseurl}}/gifs/2024-07-04-dropship.gif)
*Dropship using Emergency Thrusters*

_The new upgrade for the Dropship works in a similar way as the sc2 medivac but requires a previous research at the Control tower for 100 minerals and 100 vespene, allowing the Dropship to receive a temporary boost to leave sticky situations or make for quick drop-ins._

_Similarly with the other races the Protoss also suffer from a reduced production speed mostly due to the existence of Warp Gates for the sc2 Protoss, to that end we've added a new Upgrade to Gateways for the Mid-Late Game, we'd like some more feedback on the current Upgrade Requirements._

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Divider_Protoss.png)

_The biggest problem that we've identified with the Zerg as of yet has been a reduced production speed when compared to SC2 due to queens, to that end we've made some changes to the larvae. While this is not the only issue with the Zerg race, we'd like to gather additional feedback to make future adjustments._

![]({{site.baseurl}}/gifs/2024-07-04-queencreep.gif)

_Queens have received a modified ability replacing Ensnare, this Ability variant launches a mix of creep and the classic green goo to slow down enemies as well as create a Creep patch around the target aream this ability has a lot of potential and it could be used as part of a Nydus Proxy._
