## Evo Complete Extension Update 1.6

Hey everyone, we got a minor update containing some balance changes, bugfixes and support for some upcoming features being deployed sometime soon.

We are also working currently on a patch for Evo Legacy which is set to release soon, it aims to make our maps compatible with Legacy without requiring an additional map to be made.
